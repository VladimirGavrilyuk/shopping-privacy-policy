        <p>
            If you are using the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>2. License and Restrictions</h2>

        <h3>2.1 License Grant</h3>

        <h3>2.2 Restrictions</h3>
        <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
            <li>Modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the App</li>
            <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Anonymous Users</h3>
        <p>You may use the App anonymously without signing in with Google. Anonymous users are subject to the following limits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Limit:</strong> 1 device only (strictly enforced by device hardware ID)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sync:</strong> Not available (data stored locally only)</li>
            <li><strong>Account Recovery:</strong> Not available</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you link your anonymous account with Google Sign-In, your local data will be preserved and synced.
            However, if the Google account is already associated with another anonymous account, the existing Google account data will take precedence.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Device and Session Management</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Device Identification</h3>
        <p>
            We use your device's Android ID (hardware identifier) to manage device limits and prevent fraud.
            This identifier is permanent and survives app reinstallation (but resets if you factory reset your device).
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Device Limits</h3>
        <p><strong>Anonymous users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited to 1 device per hardware identifier</li>
            <li>Installing on a second device will result in separate, independent data</li>
            <li>To use the same account on multiple devices, sign in with Google</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Google Sign-In users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited to 3 devices at any time</li>
            <li>If you reach the limit, you must remove an old device before adding a new one</li>
            <li>Devices are identified by Android ID</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Session Management</h3>
        <p>For Google Sign-In users:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximum 3 active sessions simultaneously</li>
            <li>Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity</li>
            <li>If you exceed the session limit, the oldest session will be automatically signed out</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
